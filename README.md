## Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendations are proposed for Microsoft's new movie studio venture:

Partnerships for Revenue Maximization: Microsoft should consider partnering with Affirm studio to generate high domestic gross and also MPI and FUN studios for high foreign gross. Collaborations with established studios can leverage their expertise and resources to enhance box office performance.

Dual Focus on Domestic and Foreign Gross: It is crucial for stakeholders to concentrate on both domestic and foreign gross, as they are independent factors influencing overall profitability. Balancing efforts to cater to both markets can optimize revenue potential.

Cost Optimization for Worldwide Profits: Microsoft should prioritize increasing the cost of producing movies, as worldwide profits are highly dependent on this factor. Investing in high-quality productions can attract larger audiences globally, leading to greater financial returns.

Automation for Data Management: To avoid messy data and streamline operations, stakeholders should explore automation solutions for data entry and management processes. This will enhance efficiency and ensure data integrity across all stages of movie production and analysis.

Focus on English Language Releases: Given the broader market appeal, Microsoft should focus on releasing more English-language movies compared to other languages. English-language films tend to have higher sales potential and wider international distribution.

Volume Strategy for Popularity: Releasing a substantial number of movies can help Microsoft gain votes and popularity on platforms like The Movie DB. The number of movies released positively correlates with audience engagement metrics, such as votes and popularity, thus enhancing the studio's visibility and reputation.

By implementing these recommendations, Microsoft's movie studio can position itself for success in the competitive film industry and maximize its revenue potential.
